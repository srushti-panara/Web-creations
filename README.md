# 🌟 Web Wonderland 🚀
Welcome to my Web Wonderland! 🎨✨ <br>
This is where I experiment, play, and bring ideas to life on the web. From simple HTML pages to small interactive experiences with CSS and JavaScript, every project here is a step in my journey to becoming a web creator. <br>

## 🛠️ What I’m Exploring
**HTML**: Building the skeleton of my web pages 🏗️ <br>
**CSS**: Styling, animations, and color experiments 🎨 <br>
**JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and fun effects ⚡ <br>
**Mini projects**: Buttons, forms, galleries, and little games 🎮 <br>

## 🌱 My Learning Philosophy
The web is like a sandbox—the more you try, the more you learn. I embrace: <br>
**Curiosity**: Trying new layouts, colors, and effects <br>
**Mistakes**: Breaking things on purpose to understand them better <br>
**Iteration**: Improving designs step by step <br>

## 🚀 Goal of This Repo
Turn ideas into live web pages <br>
Learn to structure, style, and script websites from scratch <br>
Build a portfolio of projects to showcase growth <br>
